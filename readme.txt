Republish articles from world-class publishers on your site with an automated widget or by selecting individual articles. Plus, syndicate and monetize your own original content.  

== Description ==

This plugin enables any WordPress website to manage content syndication and licensing like a pro. 

iCopyright’s republishing hub, repubHub, is incorporated directly into your admin console, allowing you to republish content from many world-class publications and websites.  You choose whether to republish with an automated widget that minimizes editorial effort or to select each article you republish individually. Articles are syndicated for free from participating publishers because ads are inserted within the article iframe to compensate the content providers and iCopyright.  You monetize the republished content on your page with your usual ads surrounding the iframe.

And on the flip side of the syndication market, this plugin adds a Republish button to your articles, allowing your readers to license them instantly for many types of republication, and simultaneously feeds them into the repubHub network (www.repubhub.com) for others to discover and license.  Licenses are offered as free embeds monetized by ads and as paid licenses without ads.  

With the iCopyright Republishing Suite, you can:

* Search for and curate articles by leading publishers on topics of interest to your readers.
* Get alerts when new articles on your topics are available for republication.
* Republish them legally with just one click directly from your Posts menu.  
* For more automated republishing, deploy one or more trending headlines widgets that link to the full article on your site, keeping readers engaged with fresh, relevant content. 
* Syndicate and monetize your content with a Republish/Reprint button that offers licenses to your readers and that feeds your content into iCopyright's repubHub portal (www.repubhub.com) for others to discover and republish.
* Rest assured that all content is license-ready. No need to negotiate terms with others.

Join the network of republishable content!  The powerful iCopyright Republishing Suite plugin lets you do it all.

== Screenshots ==

1. A portion of the administrative settings page showing toolbar placement options and basic setting for your site.
2. The iCopyright Toolbar is placed on each article on your site according to styling and rules you specify. This is an example of the placement of the default toolbar. 
3. When users mouse over your toolbar, licensing options unfurl. When these options are clicked, various licensing types are presented in a menu, such as seen below. 
4. Example of the Republish Online menu.
5. The iCopyright Republishing Suite ingests the repubHub content licensing portal directly into your administrative dashboard. Clicking on "Automated widget" takes you to the repubHub Headlines Widget. Clicking on "Single articles" take you to your Posts page where you can find thousands of current articles to curate and republish.  
6. This screen shows the repubHub portal. Recent headlines from across the network are displayed by default. Select from a variety of topics, as shown in the green box, to narrow your view. You can search for relevant content in a variety of ways and save your personal searches in tabs to have immediate access to fresh articles each time you visit. (Figures in green bubbles display the total number of new articles for that folder.)   To republish any article, simply click Republish. 
7. To activate a repubHub Headlines Widget, navigate to Appearance/Widgets and drag the widget to your sidebar. Adjust the settings as desired.
8. Your widget will automatically adapt to your site’s theme and updates continually with trending news that matches the criteria you have established in the widget settings.  The widget on the left shows how a widget appears to your site visitors.  Note that your view  of the widget, shown on the right, includes curation tools that allow you to:
   * Publish any of the articles to your site instantly and permanently.
   * Remove any specific article (a new trending article will replace it, keeping your widget filled).
   * Exclude any specific source permanently.
